# Simple Operating System Simulator

**Course**: Operating Systems (CO2018)  
**Institution**: Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology  
## Overview

This project implements a simplified OS, focusing on:
- **Multilevel Queue (MLQ) Scheduler**  
- **Paging-Based Virtual Memory Management**  
- **System Call Interface** (`killall`)  
- **Synchronization Mechanisms** for multi-processor safety

Goal: The objective of this assignment is the simulation of major components in a simple operating system,
for example, scheduler, synchronization, related operations of physical memory and virtual memory.
Content: In detail, students will practice with three major modules: scheduler, synchronization, mechanism
of memory allocation from virtual-to-physical memory.
â€¢ scheduler
â€¢ synchronization
â€¢ the operations of mem-allocation from virtual-to-physical
Besides, students will practice the design and implementation of Simple Operating System programming
interface via system call.
Result: After this assignment, students can understand partly the principle of a simple OS. They can
understand and draw the role of OS key modules.
